    "### Q: How are they able to isolate the viral RNA? Does NGS (next-gen sequencing) collect bits and pieces and then they assemble them together (align them) using a reference genome?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: If mPro, aka [SARS coronavirus main proteinase](https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/3.4.22.69) is so relevant, [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2223-y), what is coding it? I can't find it anywhere in the [SARS-CoV-2 genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=graph)\n",

    "### Q: What is organic chemistry? What do I absolutely need to know in order to understand nucleic acids? Is that question even formulated correctly?\n",
